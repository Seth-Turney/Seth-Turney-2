            <h2>Welcome, Bearer of the Curse!</h2>
            <p>Welcome Curse Bearers! Let me introduce you to the rage-inducing chaos that is Dark Souls 2. This website is dedicated to 
               the second game of the Dark Souls series. My goal for creating this website is to help future or present players be prepared
               for the ride they're getting on. I plan to describe the gameplay, what enemies to prepare for, and the tactics you need to
               learn early in the game. Another reason for creating this website is because this game is easily the hardest in the series, 
               which some praise and some critique. I want to prepare players so they do not struggle through the game like i did, becuase it
               is a fun game, but sometimes the difficulty can make you overlook that. Also, this website is solely based on my opinion, so
               some of my statements may vary with you.

            <h3>What to Expect from Dark Souls 2?</h3>
            <img src="images/Dark_Souls_2_Logo.webp" alt="Dark_Souls_2_Logo"> 
            <p>Dark Souls 2 is an RPG based game that heavily requires a mixture of planning and executing attacks. Expect to fail on your 
                first try, because the entire point of the boss fights in this game is to attempt the boss, most likely die on your first try,
                and then figuring out how to avoid making the same mistake. A second thing to expect from this game is the fact that you will 
                lose all of your currency at least once. Many players see this game as punishing, because if you die, and you will, you lose 
                all of your currency and have to go retrieve it. To me, this mechanic is seen as a lesson to not try and horde too much currency
                at one time. One final thing to expect is to get frustrated. Dark Souls 2 is not the kind of game you play after a stressful day
                at work, it's a game you play where you have no plans and you are in a fairly good mood. This game requires a lot of patience,
                sometimes need more patience thatn you're willing to give it. The combined stress of possibly losing all of your currrency, having
                to run through a tough area you just managed to make to pass through again, and having to fight a boss who, at this point, is your
                mortal enemy is not a fun feeling. Because of these factors, prepare to both have fun, and have high blood pressure, by the end of 
                the game. </p>

            <h4>Does it Hold up Today?</h4>
            <p> Although the game will be 10 yeas old in March, it still holds up surprising well in 2024. The graphics and finer details are a little
                aged, so don't expect a super advanced 4K game, but that adds to the old-fashioned charm of the early games. The gameplay, while 
                convoluted and a bit confusing, still works just as good as it did a decade ago. The graphics can be a bit clunky and hard to render
                sometimes, but honestly that doesn't really hinder the game itself and you most likely won't notice these graphical bugs as you play 
                through the game. This brings me to my next point. This game has a few bugs in it, most of it being graphical, tht don't really mess with
                how the game works. For instance, sometimes your character doesn't render and you look like a ghost, or sometimes an NPC is invidible but 
                still interactable. That being said, there are a few bugs that can hinder your progress. Sometimes a door doesn't open, or a boss doesn't
                appear when you cross the fog gate. This is usually fixed by either dying, or just saving and restarting the game. Although it has it's bugs,
                this game still runs just as well as any other game in 2024. </p>
