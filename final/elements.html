            <h2>Fire</h2>
            <p>One of the most common elements out there is the fire element. The fire element involves burning your target and doing a large
               amount of damage overtime. Dark Souls 2 has various in-game blacksmiths that give you fire weapons, or gives you the materials
               needed to create a fire weapon. Of course, the fire element has its strengths and weaknesses, as it dominates the Shrine of Amana
               and the Duke's Dear Freja boss. However, it is almost useless againt the lava based Old Iron King in the Iron Keep. Another detail
               about fire is the use of pyromancies. Pyromancies are the main source of fire damage in the game, as you can summon fire pillars, 
               shoot fireballs, or even use a few poison attacks. Fire is a very common element in Dark Souls 2 and some players even use a full
               pyromancer build, as it's convenient and effective.

                <h3>Lightning</h3>
                <p>Another common element found in the game is the lightning element. Lightning is an element that is somewhat complex to master. 
                    First of all, lightning damage is connected to your faith attribute, the higher your faith, the higher your lighning damage. 
                    Secondly, lightning is arguebly, the most powerful element in the game. This element does increased damage to armored enemies, 
                    which is a very common attribute in boss enemies. Thirdly, there are very few enemies in the game that have a resistance to 
                    lightning. Only fours bosses in the game have a resistance to lightning, the fewest of all elements. Lightning weapons are common
                    among players who want to defeat a boss, as these bosses usually have no counter to lightning damage. Finally, lightning is a 
                    common element of miracles, whcih can range from healing, to status effect resistance, to even summoning lightning spears to deal
                    damage. All in all, lightning is one of the most useful and versitile elements in the game.

                <h3>Magic</h3>
                <p>The third element that carried over from the first game is the magic element. The magic element is unique as it is not commonly seen
                   on weapons, instead it is usually used in sorceries and spells. You can put the element on a weapon, however it is considerably weaker
                   than the fire and lightning elements. Sorceries are the most common type of magic damage, as most of the spells are quick, and do solid
                   damage. The magic element is also based on Intelligence, which you can usually pair with Faith to get a magic and lighting sorcerer build.
                   The biggest con to the magic element is that many enemies are highly resistant to it, so basing your entire build on the magic element is 
                   not a wise choice. Another con is that you are relatively vulnerable when using the magic element, as there is not really a good spell to
                   protect yourself from damage. While this element is beneficial to learn, it definetely should not be your only element.</p>

                <h4>Dark</h4>
                <p>One of the new additions to Dark Souls 2 is the introduction of the Dark element. This element is very similar to the magic 
                   element as they both focus on damage and offer a few buffs to the user. However, unlike sorceries and miracles, the damage 
                   is based on the lack of faith and intelligence, making it a great element to use with fire. The dark element is unfortunately
                   not as effective as some of the other elements, as some of the enemies in the game has a high level of resistance to dark damage.
                   Hexes are the most common use of the dark element, as they involve ranged attacks that can pick off enemies from a distance. You 
                   can also regenrate health at the cost of your souls, so while it is useful, if you're low on souls do not use this elements buffs.
                   While this element is certainly helpful in the later game, it can be difficult to use the full capacity of the dark element in the 
                   early parts of the game.</p>
