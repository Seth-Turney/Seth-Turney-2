            <h2>What Are the Best Dual Blades?</h2>
            <p> To me, is the best in the Dual Blade department would be the "Kadachi Claws". They are the most convenient, 
                are easy to upgrade, and are very high damaging in the later parts of the game. These weapons can be 
                obtained early in the game  and require very little to upgrade to its full potential. This weapon set
                also carries the thunder element, an element that most monsters are moderately weak to,making you a 
                threat in the field even before you obtain any late game items. The combination of availability and 
                conveniency makes the "Kadachi Claws" the best set to use in the Dual Blades class. Behind the claws are 
                dragon-based "Wrathful Predation, which can only be obtained in the later portions of the game, and the Beo 
                Hatchets, which is the only set of two that can do ice damage in the Dual Blade tree.</p>

                <h3>What is Monster Hunter World?</h3>
                <p>Monster Hunter: World is a game series developed by Capcom in 2018. The game is known for its RPG
                   elements and variety of classes available to the player. The synopsis of the game is you hunting 
                   various monsters across the land and forging the gear obtained from them. The game has recieved 
                   critical acclaim and has won the 2018 award for best role playing game of the year! This game is 
                   something I am somewhat passionate about, because I have spent a great amount of time understanding
                   how this game works. This is one of the main inspirations for creating this website, as I feel like 
                   a good understanding of how this game works is what makes this game as good as it is.

                <h3>What Are the Dual Blades?</h3>
                    <p>For those who have no idea what I'm talking about. The Dual Blades class is a weapon class used in the video game 
                    "Monster Hunter: World." In this game there are 14 weapons classes you can close from, the Dual Blades being one 
                    of those. The class consists of two small knives that, while low in damage, boasts the fastest attack speed in the 
                    game! However, through my long gameplay history in the game, I have yet to see somebody truely understand that class
                    and why it's one of the best Damage Per Second (DPS) weapons out there! A true understanding of the strategies, abilities
                    and elemental output is critical for mastering this class. This website has been created to show future players, or 
                    long-time fans of the game, why this class is one of the best there is. </p>

                <h4>What Strategies Should I Use?</h4>
                <p>The Dual Blades requires a mix of four key traits, which will be discussed
                    in the next page. You need to manage your stamina so you do not run out of energy and either leave yourself open for attacks, 
                    or leaving you unable to attack. Hit-And-Run is highly recommended as you have no protection from damage. Aerials are a hidden 
                    gem when it comes to Dual Blades, because of the large amounts of damage a good aerial can do. Finally, use your tools. Tools 
                    can be a major asset when you're in a pinch. Sometimes the tools you bring are the different to victory and defeat. </p>
