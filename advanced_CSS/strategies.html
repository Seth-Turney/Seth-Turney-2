            <h2>Stamina Management</h2>
            <p>One of the most valuable aspects of Monster Hunter: World is stamina. Stamina is what makes your character capable of doing 
                basically anyting in the game. From running to dodging to even attacking, stamina is the one thing you don't want to lose. 
                Unfortunately, the Dual Blades are not very friendly when it comes to stamina consumptions. Your main form of attack, Demon
                Form, holds the unforunate drawback of quickly draining your stamina over time, which means you have to quickly switch in
                and out of Demon Form to both maintain your stamina, while doing good damage. There are many skills in the game that can help 
                you with this drawback. There are skills that increase your stamina, decrease the depletion of stamina, and even prevents hunger!
                Being able to effectively maintain stamina is the first step to mastering Dual Blades.</p>

                <h3>Hit-and-Run</h3>
                <p>The hit-and-run strategy is the moveset of attacking, followed by retreating. In this game, that strategy is a very wise 
                   tactic. Most of the monsters in this game are very large and do very high amounts of damage, so facing them head on is 
                   not a very wise idea. The Dual Blades need to follow this tactic especially, as they have no way to protect the user, making
                   every attack they get hit by that much more devastating. By following the hit-and-run tactic, you prevent yourself from being
                   countered and you get enough time to recover you stamina, health, or find an opening to attack your target. Another benefit of 
                   this strategy is the "Spinning Blade Slash" why helps you get out of range and reposition even faster. By combining the spinning
                   slash method and the hit and run strategy makes you an untouchable warrior on the field.</p>

                <h3>Aerials</h3>
                <p>Aerials are the most effective attack you can do in the Dual Blades class. The aerial attack involves jumping and doing
                    a series of midair spinning slashes that does massive damage to your target. This attack also removes the height problem
                    mentioned in the first page, as you can reach almost any monster with this attack. Midair attaks are also effective for 
                    knocking flying monsters out of the air. While not guaranteed, you can do signifigant damage to the head, back, and tail
                    which gives you more parts, and also stuns your target. The only disadvantage to the aerial attack is that your hitbox is
                    increased, making it easier to be countered and knocked to the ground by the monster you are hunting.</p>

                <h4>Use Tools</h4>
                <p>Your tools are easily the most valuable asset a hunter can use. There's a tool for everything! Whether that be sharpning
                   your weapon, stunning a monster, or even putting a monster to sleep. These tools are key to giving your hunter oppertunities
                   to attack and slay your target. Similar to attack items, there are also items to help you defensively. There's life powders, 
                   which help you gain health in a pinch. Armorskins, which greatly increases your defense, making you able to atack a monster more
                   aggresively. There's even mantles, whcih can do anything from cloaking, to elemental resistance, to even damage immunity! These 
                   tools are something that you need to add to your strategy to make your hunt much easier in the future.

                <h3>What Are the Dual Blades?</h3>
                    <p>For those who have no idea what I'm talking about. The Dual Blades class is a weapon class used in the video game 
                    "Monster Hunter: World." In this game there are 14 weapons classes you can close from, the Dual Blades being one 
                    of those. The class consists of two small knives that, while low in damage, boasts the fastest attack speed in the 
                    game! However, through my long gameplay history in the game, I have yet to see somebody truely understand that class
                    and why it's one of the best Damage Per Second (DPS) weapons out there! A true understanding of the strategies, abilities
                    and elemental output is critical for mastering this class. This website has been created to show future players, or 
                    long-time fans of the game, why this class is one of the best there is. </p>

                <h3>What Strategies Should I Use?</h3>
                <p>The Dual Blades requires a mix of four key traits, which will be discussed
                    in the next page. You need to manage your stamina so you do not run out of energy and either leave yourself open for attacks, 
                    or leaving you unable to attack. Hit-And-Run is highly recommended as you have no protection from damage. Aerials are a hidden 
                    gem when it comes to Dual Blades, because of the large amounts of damage a good aerial can do. Finally, use your tools. Tools 
                    can be a major asset when you're in a pinch. Sometimes the tools you bring are the different to victory and defeat. </p>
