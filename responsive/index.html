            <h2>Welcome Hunters!</h2>
            <p>Greetings Hunters! This website is dedicated to explaining a hunter class I feel is underutilized in the Monster Hunter 
                series. In the Monster Hunter World universe, there are 14 different classes you can choose from, whether that be the 
                health-giving "Hunter Horn," The super-powerful "Greatsword," or the lighting-quick "Dual Blades." Most classes in the 
                game are commonly seen by the other players you see around on the servers of the game. However, I've seen a weapon that, 
                while used rather frquently, is often used incorrectly by other players. That class is the Dual Blade class. By creating 
                this website, I hope to show some strategies and play styles that truely show how strong this weapon class actually is. I 
                plan to educate you on what to do, what to avoid, and the best set to use in this class. Hopefully this website can be 
                helpful in dicovering a new favorite weapon class.</p>

            <h3>Why Should I Use Dual Blades?</h3>
            <p>Of the 14 classes available in the game, the Dual Blades gives you abilities no other class comes close too. This class
                focuses on overall speed instead of raw damage, making it weaker than say, a fully charged Hammer strike or a Charged 
                Greatsword slam, but that's what makes this weapon such a silent powerhouse. Unlike the Greatsword or Hammer, you don't 
                need to spend your time waiting and watching for an opening to strike, you can run in and strike for damage at any 
                oppertunity. This is what makes weapons so powerful, you aren't limited to ranged attacks or finding a perfect time.
                Another benefit is the mobility of these weapons. One of the best attacks for this weapon class is the spinning slash,
                which both damages the monster you're hunting and changes your position. Positioning is a critical in this game as it 
                gives you amazing openings to attack a monster's weak point, something the dual blades class is a master at. The Dual
                Blades class is both a master at manuverability and DPS, making it an unexpected monster hunting machine in the Monster
                Hunter series. </p>

            <h4>Why the Dual Blades May Not be for You</h4>
            <p> Although the Dual Blades class has many advantages, there are also some disadvantages that need to be discussed as well.
                One major disadvantage that befalls the Dual Blades is its inability to block. This is crucial, as your chacter will take
                full damage from any attack that hits them. This disadvantage makes means it's a common  occurence for you to get stunlocked
                by the monster you are hunting, as you cannot protect yourself. Another disadvantage that the Dual Blades has is the stamina
                consumption their abilities use. One of the main aspects of the Dual Blades is you "Demon Form," an ability that increases 
                your damage and attack speed. However, this ability also quickly drains your stamina, and when that happens, you lose your
                ability to run or dodge. This disadvantage can be unappealing to players who do not want to focus on watching their stamina
                in the heat of battle. One final disadvantage is the lack of range this class has. In a world where there are giant swords 
                and hammers, two little knives aren't exactly the most desired weapon option for really tall monsters. The Dual Blades makes 
                that apparent. For most of the battle, you wil be forced to attack the ankles of the monster, as your range of attack is 
                extremely small. This makes if hard to do big plays like head hits or tail cuts. When you're hunting a monster with the Dual 
                Blades class, do not expect to do major physical damage to a monster, you will be thoroughly dissapointed.</p>

                <h2>What Are the Dual Blades?</h2>
                <p>For those who have no idea what I'm talking about. The Dual Blades class is a weapon class used in the video game 
                "Monster Hunter: World." In this game there are 14 weapons classes you can close from, the Dual Blades being one 
                of those. The class consists of two small knives that, while low in damage, boasts the fastest attack speed in the 
                game! However, through my long gameplay history in the game, I have yet to see somebody truely understand that class
                and why it's one of the best Damage Per Second (DPS) weapons out there! A true understanding of the strategies, abilities
                and elemental output is critical for mastering this class. This website has been created to show future players, or 
                long-time fans of the game, why this class is one of the best there is. </p>

                <h3>What Strategies Should I Use?</h3>
                <p>The Dual Blades requires a mix of four key traits, which will be discussed
                    in the next page. You need to manage your stamina so you do not run out of energy and either leave yourself open for attacks, 
                    or leaving you unable to attack. Hit-And-Run is highly recommended as you have no protection from damage. Aerials are a hidden 
                    gem when it comes to Dual Blades, because of the large amounts of damage a good aerial can do. Finally, use your tools. Tools 
                    can be a major asset when you're in a pinch. Sometimes the tools you bring are the different to victory and defeat. </p>
