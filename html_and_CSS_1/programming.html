            <h2>About Programming</h2>
            <p>There are many different tech based careers out there in the world, one of those is Programming.
                In this website I will discuss the what programming is, why it is beneficial, and why it not be 
                appeasing to you. This guide serves as crash course on what to expect for these career choices 
                moving forward and what your day-to-day may look like. Keep in mind that some of the opions stated 
                in this website are my opinion, which can be vastly diffferent from yours. I hope to inform you of 
                pros and cons of each career choice and to also help you decide your next step in a tech based career.</p>

                <h3>Examples of Programming?</h3>
                <p> In the world of Programming, there are many different websites, applications, and languages used to 
                    create codes. One of the most common coding languages out there is JavaScript. Javascript is a 
                    one of many programming languages that allows you to command and implement a set of instuctions to 
                    your computer. JavaScript is used in many different games, applications, and artifical intelligence 
                    developments. Java is also one of the easiest langauges to understand, as it lacks the complexity of
                    some of its other competitiors. Another tool used in the field of programming is binary. Binary is a 
                    concept where values are deduced using a series of 0s and 1s. Binry code is used to manipulate files 
                    and create and control the flow of information through your CPU. Binary is mainly used to encode and 
                    encrypt data, so you may see more of it as you work closer to the CPU level of the computer. Both of 
                    these programming types help to create and run the complex machine we call a computer, which is why
                    learning both of them is beneficial for any future technology careers.</p>
